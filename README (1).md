# Virtual Reality Interview Preparation Tool

Welcome to the repository for our Virtual Reality Interview Preparation Tool! This project aims to revolutionize interview preparation for university students by offering an immersive, realistic, and interactive VR experience. Our tool is designed to boost confidence, enhance interview skills, and provide comprehensive feedback to help students succeed in real-world job interviews.

## Project Aims

The primary goals of this project are:
- **Enhance Interview Readiness**: Provide a realistic, immersive interview environment to reduce anxiety and improve preparedness.
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Deliver real-time, AI-driven feedback on verbal and non-verbal performance.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the tool is inclusive and accessible to users with diverse needs.
- **Self-Paced Practice**: Allow users to practice privately and at their own pace.

## How It Works

Our Virtual Reality Interview Preparation Tool operates as follows:

1. **Immersive VR Environment**: Students enter a virtual interview room that mimics real-world settings.
2. **AI-Driven Interviewers**: AI-powered virtual interviewers conduct the interview, asking industry-specific questions.
3. **Real-Time Feedback**: The AI provides immediate feedback on speech, body language, and overall performance.
4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Post-interview, the tool generates a detailed report highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**:
    - Ensure you have a compatible VR headset and Unreal Engine installed.
    - Clone the repository and open the project in Unreal Engine.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vr-interview-prep.git
    cd vr-interview-prep
    # Open the project in Unreal Engine
    ```

    - Alternatively, if you do not wish to set up the development environment, download the provided APK file and install it directly on your Oculus device.

2. **Launch the Application**:
    - Start the VR application on your device and enter the virtual interview room.

3. **Begin Interview**:
    - Follow the prompts to start the interview session with the AI-driven interviewer.
    - If using Oculus Quest 2, which is recommended, Press A button on right controller before talking and stop pressing it after you have finished talking. This allows the game to record your mic input which is processed by the AI interviewer so the interview can run smoothly.

4. **Receive Feedback**:
    - After completing the interview, receive real-time feedback and a comprehensive performance analysis report.

## Generated Report

The tool generates a detailed report after each interview session, which includes:

- **Verbal Response Analysis**: Assessment of your answers, including content, clarity, and relevance.
- **Body Language Evaluation**: Analysis of your body language, posture, and eye contact (experimental feature).
- **Emotional Tone**: Evaluation of the emotional tone of your responses.
- **Overall Performance Score**: A combined score reflecting your overall interview performance.
- **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**: Personalized feedback highlighting what you did well and what needs improvement.
